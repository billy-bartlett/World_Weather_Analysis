# World_Weather_Analysis

For this project, I created 3 deliverables. 

1. I generated random latitudes and longitudes and associated them with cities. I then used the OpenWeatherMap API and the citipy module to pull the following information for those cities: latitude and longitude, maximum temperature, percent humidity, percent cloudiness, wind speed, and weather description.

2. I then created a customer travel destinations map using the information from deliverable 1. This map allows a customer to select a minimum and maximum temperature and then identifies which cities the customer may be interested in traveling to. Next, I pulled hotel names for each city and generated a map with markers to display hotel name, city, country, and current weather for each city.

3. Lastly, I created a travel itenerary map that provided directions for each city the customer wanted to travel to. I again added markers and an information box that displayed hotel name, city, country, and the current weather conditions for each city.
